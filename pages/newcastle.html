        <h1>The City of Newcastle</h1>
        <h3>Newcastle upon Tyne – or simply ‘Newcastle’ as it is most commonly referred to – is one of the most iconic cities in Britain, famous for its industrial heritage, eponymous brown ale, popular nightlife and distinct regional ‘Geordie’ dialect.
          Located in the North East of England on the banks of the River Tyne, the city has undergone several transformations since it began life as a Roman fort on Hadrian’s Wall in 122AD. The settlement was known as Pons Aelius, or Aelian Bridge in Latin, ‘Aelian’ being the family name of Emperor Hadrian. In the wake of the Roman’s departure from Britain in 410AD, Pons Aelius was renamed Monkchester and subsumed into the influential Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria.</h3>

        <h1>The Angel of the North</h1>
        <h3>Gateshead Council's brief was simple; to create an ambitious artwork that would become a landmark of the region's character. Antony Gormley's winning design is now one of the most viewed pieces of art in the world. It is seen by more than one person every second. That's 90,000 every day or 33 million every year. 
          With its prime location, on a panoramic hilltop by the A1, the Angel of the North has become one of the most famous artworks in the region.  The sculpture was installed in February 1998 and over the last twenty years has become one of the most recognisable pieces of public art ever produced, winning many accolades and awards.
          The Angel of the North is located close to A1 and is easy to reach by both public transport and car.</h3>
